# Challenge sheet

This is a harder group theory question.

It turns out that two of the axioms in the standard definition of a group
are not needed; they can be deduced from the others. Let's define
a "weak group" class, where we only have three of the group axioms.
The question is: can you prove that a weak group is a group, by
proving the other axioms?

-/

namespace Section5sheet2


-- removing `mul_one` and `mul_inv_self` from the five standard axioms
-- for a group.
class WeakGroup (G : Type) extends One G, Mul G, Inv G where
  mul_assoc : ∀ a b c : G, a * b * c = a * (b * c)
  one_mul : ∀ a : G, 1 * a = a
  inv_mul_cancel : ∀ a : G, a⁻¹ * a = 1

namespace WeakGroup

-- Let `G` be a "weak group" and say a,b,c are in G
variable {G : Type} [WeakGroup G] (a b c : G)

/-

The (tricky) challenge is to prove that G is a group, which we can interpret as
proving the missing axioms `mul_one` and `mul_inv_cancel`. Note that you
can't use the `group` tactic any more because `G` isn't a group yet:
this is what you're trying to prove!

One way of doing it: try proving

`mul_left_cancel : a * b = a * c → b = c`

and then

`mul_eq_of_eq_inv_mul : b = a⁻¹ * c → a * b = c`

first.

-/

theorem mul_left_cancel (h : a * b = a * c) : b = c := by
  have h1 : a⁻¹ * (a * b) = a⁻¹ * (a * c)
  rw [h]
  rw [← mul_assoc a⁻¹, ← mul_assoc a⁻¹] at h1
  rw [inv_mul_cancel, one_mul, one_mul] at h1
  exact h1

theorem mul_eq_of_eq_inv_mul (h : b = a⁻¹ * c) : a * b = c := by
  rw [← one_mul b] at h
  rw [← inv_mul_cancel a] at h
  rw [mul_assoc] at h
  apply mul_left_cancel at h
  exact h


theorem mul_one (a : G) : a * 1 = a := by
  nth_rewrite 2 [← one_mul a]
  nth_rewrite 2 [← inv_mul_cancel a]
  rw [mul_assoc]
  rw [mul_eq_of_eq_inv_mul]
  nth_rewrite 2 [← mul_assoc]
  rw [inv_mul_cancel, one_mul, inv_mul_cancel]

theorem mul_inv_cancel (a : G) : a * a⁻¹ = 1 := by
  apply mul_eq_of_eq_inv_mul
  rw [mul_one]

And now we have all the pieces of information, we can put them together in this lemma.

instance : Group G where
  mul_assoc := mul_assoc
  one_mul := one_mul
  mul_one := mul_one
  inv_mul_cancel := inv_mul_cancel

end WeakGroup

If you want to take this further: prove that if we make
a new class `BadGroup` by replacing
`one_mul` by `mul_one` in the definition of `weak_group`
then it is no longer true that you can prove `mul_inv_cancel`;
there are structures which satisfy `mul_assoc`, `mul_one`
and `inv_mul_cancel` but which really are not groups.
Can you find an example? Try it on paper first.

-/
-- claim: not a group in general
class BadGroup (G : Type) extends One G, Mul G, Inv G where
  mul_assoc : ∀ a b c : G, a * b * c = a * (b * c)
  mul_one : ∀ a : G, a * 1 = a
  inv_mul_cancel : ∀ a : G, a⁻¹ * a = 1

-- Here's the answer!
-- `Bool` is a type with two terms, `Bool.true` and `Bool.false`. See if you can make it into
-- a bad group which isn't a group!
instance : One Bool :=
  ⟨Bool.true⟩

instance : Mul Bool :=
  ⟨∨⟩

instance : Inv Bool :=
  ⟨¬⟩

instance : BadGroup Bool where
  mul_assoc := by decide
  -- `by decide`, might be able to do this
  mul_one := sorry
  -- by decide
  inv_mul_cancel := sorry
  -- by decide

example : ¬∀ a : Bool, 1 * a = a := by sorry
-- by decide
